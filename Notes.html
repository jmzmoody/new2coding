  <h1>Lesson 1:Learning To Code</h1>

  <h2>General Notes</h2>
    <h3>What is the web?</h3>
    <p>It's a bunch of computers referred to as servers that host files.  The web was actually invented in the early 90's.</p>
    <h3>How do you communicate with the web?</h3>
    <p>Using a browser on your computer, you send messages using the primary protocl HTTP.</p>
    <h3>How do you create code?</h3>
    <p>In order to create code you need a special editor,
      Atom is the editor that I chose.  One of the neat features
      about Atom is that you can preview your code in the editor.
    </p>
    <p>An important concept to remember is that computers interpret language
      literally, unlike humans who often use context. A simple syntax mistake
      can cause large and confusing problems in code.
    </p>
    <h3>Basic <b>HTML</b> Elements</h3>
    <p>Most elements have opening and closing tags.
      Tags can be used to format text in <b>bold</b> or <em>italics</em>.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to basic tags, HTML also utilizes attributes which
    provide additional information to the browser.  With attributes you can insert
    <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/b920608d-be3c-4d5f-851f-6ab3eeb8997b/modules/8f2b6689-b7fd-4c54-9c13-99bb29278990/lessons/94e3a192-b124-42e8-9023-4d5be425e389/concepts/1d24ea7a-2b40-4186-aa1e-c9d45745ffa9"> helpful links</a>
    such as this one. It provided us with an example of how our first project might look.
    </p>
    <h3>A few Tags that we have learned</h3>
    <p>"b" is used to bold <b>text</b> <br>
    "em" is used to emphasize <em>text</em>in italics <br>
    "br" is a void tag, that does not require an end tag and is used to provide a line break <br>
    "div" creates a "box" container element <br>
    "span" creates an "inline" container element <br>
    <b>Void</b> tags have no content <br>
    <b>Inline</b> elements are just text <br>
    <b>Block</b> elements create a block around text that have both heighth and width <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Jan is having fun learning to code!</h2>
    <p>An important lesson that I learned is to ensure that I have "saved" my file.
      Atom does not autosave your work! And my second project attempt is <b>better</b> than
      my first!

      <h1>Lesson 2: Adding Style and Flair</h1>
      <h2>General Notes</h2>
      <p>HTML is a good language to begin learning code because it is so
      visual and the feedback can be immediate.  HTML, CSS and Javascript
      are all languages that have different purposes in Web Development.
      HTML provides the structure, while CSS controls the style.</p>
      <h2>Developer Tools</h2>
      <p>In the video that we watched, we learned how to access developer tools
      using Google Chrome.  It was interesting to find that not all elements are
      visible, that everything on Web page is <em>really</em> a square, whether it
      looks like one or not and that when you dig deep enough into the code, you
      <em>really</em> can find all the text!</p>
      <h2>Tree Like Structure</h2>
      <p>Your code, like your family, has a tree like structure.  Translating
      your code into it's own "family tree" will help you see the relationships
      between the elements.</p>
      <h2>Making Your Web Page Stylish</h2>
      <p>When you begin to make web pages, you need to design the layout in boxes.
      The "div" tag will help you create the boxes.  The "class" will help you
      add style to the content in the box.</p>
